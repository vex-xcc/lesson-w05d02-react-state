## Review Guide: React State

Below, you'll find key terms, key concepts, key code snippets, and further reading - all covering the basics of React state and binding.

### Key Terms & Definitions

* **Constructor**
  * A constructor is only called once, when the component is initially created.
  * Constructors say, "When you create an instance of this class, do this."
  * If you aren't doing anything special, you don't need to define a constructor method
    * It happens automatically for you using the default constructor inherited from the basic class (in our case, the `Component` class)
  * If you have a defined constructor method, the first line of it will always be `super()`.
    * `super()` means: "When this class is created, you should still do the default initialization for this class."
  * Refer to the "Key Code Snippets - Constructor" section below for an example

* **Map**
  - While not a key concept for React, map is a very handy thing to know.
  - A map is like a `for` loop.
    - With `map`, you make a new variable and with it iterate through each item in an array.
  - Refer to the "Key Code Snippets - Map" section below for examples.

* **State**
  * A `state` is in a component. It is similar to a `prop`, but it is used for data that changes over time.
  * Like `props`, which we access with `this.props.val`, we can access `state` values using `this.state.val`
  * Set initial state in the `constructor` method of a component, creating a name and an initial value
  * `state` just represents the state of data on our page. Something saved to `state` in React is not automatically saved to a database or to local storage. If you refresh the page, all `state` is lost.
  * Refer to the "Key Code Snippets - State" section below for examples



### Key Concepts
* **What triggers a UI change:**
  - In a React component, an update in either the `state` or `props` will trigger the method cascade that can lead to a `render`.
  - Our component calculates the difference ("diff") between the current DOM and the virtual DOM node
  - Then, it figures out how to update the state of the DOM in as few manipulations as possible
    - It only replaces the current DOM with parts that have changed.
    - This is one of React's core advantages.

- **Do not:**
  - Don't automatically render elements on the DOM *inside* their own component class definitions.
    - In a component class, you should define a `render` method for that component.
    - That class then is called by `ReactDOM.render` in **a different place, outside that class definition** (likely `index.js`).
  - In some tutorials or older code, you may find examples of `ReactDOM.render` inside a component, but you should avoid this at all costs; this was an older technique used in past versions of React.

- **Important Reminder**
  - Remember that `state` and `props` are not the same thing.
    - `State` represents the _state_ of your user interface component, and is changeable based on a user action (e.g. clicking a button to increase mood)
    - `props` are passed in to a component and not changeable by that component (e.g. the user's name might be passed in to be displayed)


### Key Code Snippets - Constructor

**A component with an empty constructor**

```js
class Hello extends Component {
  // what should happen when the component is first created
  constructor() {
    // make call to parent class' (Component) constructor
    super();
  }

  // what should the component render
  render() {
    //  ....
  }
}
```


### Key Code Snippets - Map

**General `map` Syntax**

```js
let <new_Variable_Name> = <the_Array_We_Are_Iterating>.map((local_Variable_Name_to_Loop, index) => (
  <what_To_Do_With_Each_Item_in_Loop>
));
```

**Specific `map` Example**
Here's a simple example that makes a new array by adding `!` to each element of an array:

```js
const phrases = ['ice cream', 'dinosaurs', 'hobbits']; // the array

const excitedPhrases = phrases.map((phrase, index) => {
  return newPhrase = phrase + '!';
});
// excitedPhrases is ["ice cream!", "dinosaurs!", "hobbits!"]
```


### Key Code Snippets - State

**Setting an initial state**
```js
constructor(props) {
  // make call to parent class' (Component) constructor
  super();
  // define an initial state
  this.state = {
    moodPoints: 1 // initialize this.state.moodPoints to be 1
  };
}
```

**Changing a state's value**

```js
increaseMood(e) {
  this.setState({
    moodPoints: this.state.moodPoints + 1
  });
}
```

**Using a state's value**
```html
<p>You are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}</p>
```
